Unsupervised learning for fault detection and diagnosis of air handling units,"@article{yan2020unsupervised,
 abstract = {Supervised learning techniques have witnessed significant successes in fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Despite the good performance, these techniques heavily rely on balanced datasets that contain a large amount of both faulty and normal data points. In real-world scenarios, however, it is often very challenging to collect a sufficient amount of faulty training samples that are necessary for building a balanced training dataset. In this paper, we introduce a framework that utilizes},

Data-driven fault diagnosis for residential variable refrigerant flow system on imbalanced data environments,"@article{zhou2021data,
 abstract = {Data-driven approach has emerged as a popular research method for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of variable refrigerant flow system. However, one serious issue has been raised in recent studies, which shows that training classifiers with datasets which suffer of imbalanced class distributions can significantly influence the final classification accuracy. So, aiming at the imbalanced dataset environment problem of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system based on data-driven fault detect and diagnosis, we conducted a study. First of all},

This article presents a novel method for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). This study focused on a real system with a water thermal storage tank. First, system behaviors in response to faults were determined using a detailed system simulation. Then, a fault database was generated using the simulation results with fault labels. We preprocessed the database and converted the data into images. Then},

Detection and diagnosis for sensor fault in HVAC systems,"@article{du2007detection,

Three PCA models, based on energy balance and air side and water side flow pressure balances, respectively, are set up to detect whether there is any abnormality occurring in the systems. With any fault discovered, a joint angle plot, which compares the new fault vector with known ones in the library, can be used to isolate the faulty sensor indeed.

Complex devices are connected daily and eagerly generate vast streams of multidimensional telemetry. These devices often operate in distinct modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant, etc.), and to prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes.
