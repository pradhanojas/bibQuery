Sensor fault detection and validation of VAV terminals in air conditioning systems,"@article{wang2005sensor,
 abstract = {Sensor failure and bias are harmful to the process control of air conditioning systems, resulting in poor control of the indoor environment and waste of energy. A strategy is developed for the flow sensor fault detection and validation of variable air volume (VAV) terminals in air conditioning systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) models at both system and terminal levels are built and employed in the strategy. Sensor faults are detected using both the T 2 statistic and square prediction error (SPE) and isolated using the SPE},

Smart building creation in large scale HVAC environments through automated fault detection and diagnosis,"@article{dey2020smart,
 abstract = {Modernization and retrofitting of older buildings has created a drive to install Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) that can assist building managers in paving the way for smarter energy use and indirectly, using appropriate methods, occupant comfort understanding. BEMS may discover problems that can inform managers of building maintenance and energy wastage issues and in-directly, via repetitive data patterns appreciate user comfort requirements.

Transfer learning-based strategies for fault diagnosis in building energy systems,"@article{liu2021transfer,
 abstract = {Data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in building energy systems is typically limited by the quantity and quality of training data. These methods can be only used for individual systems due to the insufficient extrapolation capabilities of most machine learning algorithms. A desirable solution is to utilize transfer learning, which can transfer the knowledge learned from data-rich building energy systems to FDD tasks in data-sparse systems. However, the potential of applying transfer learning to such FDD has not been},

Unsupervised learning for fault detection and diagnosis of air handling units,"@article{yan2020unsupervised,
 abstract = {Supervised learning techniques have witnessed significant successes in fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Despite the good performance, these techniques heavily rely on balanced datasets that contain a large amount of both faulty and normal data points. In real-world scenarios, however, it is often very challenging to collect a sufficient amount of faulty training samples that are necessary for building a balanced training dataset. In this paper, we introduce a framework that utilizes},
